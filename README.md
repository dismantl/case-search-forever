# Case Search Forever
Never see that goddamn disclaimer page again.

This is a minimalist Chrome extension that allows you to use the Maryland Judiciary Case Search without having to click through the disclaimer page. No UI, no settings, it just works behind the scenes. The `blueprint.py` file is a Flask microservice for proxying MJCS session cookies without CORS limitations. Inspired by [Case Search Extender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/case-search-extender/nidmdangdkljbajgikhjgephonamfaem).
